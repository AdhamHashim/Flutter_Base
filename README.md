📦 Custom Clean Architecture Template for Flutter
This repository provides a highly customizable and scalable Clean Architecture boilerplate for Flutter applications. It is designed to help developers build maintainable, testable, and modular apps by applying best practices in software architecture.

🔧 Features
✅ Clean Architecture Layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data layers are clearly separated.

✅ Modular Structure: Supports code reusability and scalability.

✅ Dependency Injection: Easy service management using get_it.

✅ State Management: Supports BLoC / Cubit (or other plugable options).

✅ Repository Pattern: Abstract data sources for flexibility and testability.

✅ Error Handling: Centralized failure management and clean result modeling.

✅ Easy to Extend: Ideal for medium to large-scale projects.
